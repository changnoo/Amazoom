## Amazoon

An Amazon clone. This clone automatically simulates a warehouse in real-time. For example, when an order is placed through our webpage, robots will physically move around the warehouse, gather the order's items and place them into a truck, all without any human interaction. Synchronization is achieved through mutual exclusion and a database that holds live information about orders and items. Completed as a term project for a Systems Software Engineering course. Written in C# with an ASP.NET MVC webpage, MongoDB database and WinForms as a graphical display for the warehouse. <br>
